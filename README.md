# API Project

## Overview:
This project is to develop an web application using and API and how API's work. The basis of the project is that we have a database with 3 tables (Categories, Zones and Devices), these 3 tables contains information on Internet-of-Thing devices. A web application is then used to access the 3 tables on the database, this web application will be used to monitor the devices, zones and categories. With this web app you can create, read, update and delete records. All this is done through an API.

The database is hosted in the Cloud on Azure and I have developed an API that will also be hosted on Azure to access the data on the database through a RESTful API. The API is developed using .NET EntityFrameworkCore. To test that the API works and that it can access the database I have used swagger to be the interface to the API to test that we can Create, Read, Update and Delete data in the database.
